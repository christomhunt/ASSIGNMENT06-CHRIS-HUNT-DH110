## Interface Design

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to redesign musictheory.net to provide a better user experience to anyone who will use the website. To achieve this I will talk to users who fit the demographics as well as others who are interested in such an application that they can provide feedback that will help push along the design to create a better experience.

Interface Design allows Designer/Researcher to put up higher fidelity prototypes with the feedback they gathered from prior tests. That way you can make sure you're on the right track. Testing different Interface Design helps identify what the original website was doing well along with what the Designer/Researcher can change.

>Summary of findings from 5 second usability test:
>
>   Logo and flag are the first things to stick out. "There's a little happy face on the top (referring to the logo), Flag in the corner (referring to the USA flag in the bottom right." So right away the user is able to identify the logo of the website along with the language in which they are reading the website. After reviewing the footage I should have asked what does the user think clicking those items will do to see if they're able to understand what each one does or if there's something I can do on my end that can make it more clear for them.

>   "The one on the left is the easiest one to read, the other two the fonts, the middle one the fonts are too close to each other it's hard to make out the letters. The last one's fonts looked like they're squeezed; they're flattened out like somebody put them in a vice and flattened them they look like they're pixley. First one is the most easiest to read out of all the three."
>   Inter (the text being used in the most left image) is the easiest to read. We also learn that the bottom right design in the shape layout was the easiest to read and understand.
